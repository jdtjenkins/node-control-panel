# Node Control Panel ðŸš€
### The GUI for running node projects

Tired of the command line? Want to run multiple projects at the same time easily, and without having a billion terminal tabs? Then you've come to the right place!

## To install
`npm install -g jdtjenkins/node-control-panel`

## To run
`ncp start`

This will launch the project on port `1337`.

## To use
Simply type a local directory path into the search bar at the top. This will search all immediate subfolders of that directory for `package.json` files, and will return all projects and scripts to run.
